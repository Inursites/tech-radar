      <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

      <p>
        The Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring
          assignment</em>. I use four rings with the following semantics:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Used in production environment, low risk and recommended to
          be widely used.</li>

        <li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I started to use, solve a
          real problem; TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky</li>

        <li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for me;
          I read, learn and monitor such technolologies. Sometimes i started a prototyping effort ASSESS
          technologies have higher risks.</li>

        <li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; This does not always mean that technology is bad, it just means
          that it is not in my interest. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects,
          but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

      <p>
        This tool shows my skills and directions in which I intend to develop. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering
          work of ThoughtWorks</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>BTW, if you would like to create your own Tech Radar &mdash; I have <a href="https://github.com/yaneek/tech-radar">open
            sourced the code</a> to generate this visualization.</em>
